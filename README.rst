==========

ROS driver for devices supporting the IEEE 1394 Digital Camera
(IIDC) protocol. Supports the ROS image_pipeline_, using libdc1394_
for device access.

.. note:: 

       During the ROS Hydro development cycle the master branch is
       being migrated to catkin (issue_1_).  If you want to build for
       Groovy, use the ``groovy-devel`` branch, with rosmake.
